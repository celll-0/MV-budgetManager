# **Budget Management System**

**Initial Goals** - 
Create budget management application for tracking income and outgoings that allows for documenting transactions & bill prioritisation. It should facilitate efficient fund allocation & management for user defined categories.


### **Development Environment Setup_**
- **IDE** - Using IntelliJ IDEA for its great compatibility with java projects and integrated configuration capabilities with maven.
- **JDK** - Adaptium Eclipse Temurin V21 - includes the JRE and Javac to run java applications.
- **Git Versioning** - Set up a git repository so that code changes could be push to remote and shared across teams and different machines. Provides great collaboration and development capabilities, and security (by not having code store on one machine).

Project structure follows standard java-maven layout with the `pom.xml` config file and main source file in the root directory, along with a `.gitignore` containing common non-committable files and file types. There is also a `.idea` that's automatically generated by IntelliJ containing essential configurations for the compiler, text encodings, external repositories, versioning and workspaces.

The source directory has two subdirectories:
- `main/` - containing the java application code and logic
- `test/` - contains automated test that can be run as part of a build process, at runtime and whenever else they are needed.
